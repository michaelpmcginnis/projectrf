I created Project RF to have a reporting framework that provides consistent reports for various vulnerability scanning tools.  The project started with support for Nessus, Eeye Retina, and Nmap expanded with reporting for HP WebInpect,  AppScan AppDetective, Kismet, and GFI Languard.  This project is still in its alpha stages as Iâ€™m not a top notch web program developer.  Scan results are exported to XML which is then uploaded, parsed, and imported into a backend MySQL database.  I have found this framework very useful in generating reports for my workpapers.
